## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing IPL cricket match data using Python. It provides insights into player performances, including batting and bowling stats, strike rates, economy rates, and seasonal trends.

It is designed as a practical application of Python data analytics and is part of my learning and portfolio as a final-year engineering student.
